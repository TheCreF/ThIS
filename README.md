# ThIS - Theater Information System

**(this is the english version. Please, see below for Italian version - French and German versione will be available in the very next future)**

** Theater Information System ** based on data, exported in CSV format, from Ticketcorner Booking Application (SALES). Built by AlgoritmiX

Why a Theater Information System?
Many small theaters mostly in Switzerland, but also in other countries, relies their ticket sales on the desktop application produced by Ticketcorner, that is the Swiss branch of Eventim for Events (Music, Dance, Drama, etc.) ticket management, mostly sales.

Unfortunately, Ticketcorner applications are not free of charge. To be honest, the company using that application called SALES pays a fee for each ticket emitted, just as an online user does when reserving and paying for a ticket, plus an annual fee...
This commission is not exactly cheap... So if the company is a big company (e.g. a big theater) is not a so heavy payment, but for small companies could be a great effort.

In addition, one of the most important issues for an Event Promoter is to have an overview of the final results of the entire organized season: How many tickets we sold? Which has been the most booked event? we sold also Subscriptions, but how many Subscriptions we sold this year, also compared to previous seasons?

SALES, by itself, doesn't provide these "marketing" information. You have to subscribe to another Ticketcorner application, that is as SALES rented for an annual fee. And the fee probably is not so cheap... For Small Event Companies is another cost to be added to the revenues.

Luckily, SALES has a feature that allows to export in ".csv" format the information of all the Customers bought a ticket for a specific event. If you manage more than a single event, of different types along an entire Season could be a nightmare to gather all the information got at different timing for the current seanson (sales evolves, hopefully) or, after the end of the Subscription campaign, having anoverview of how the business evolved, also comparing with the past or more recent season or seasons

**_ThIS_**, would like to to be the *Low Cost* application to aggregate all data and generate a Marketing Dashboard
